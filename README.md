# Milestone-Project

Welcome to my Snake game!

My inspiration for making this game comes from my childhood, I wouldn't be able to count the number of hours I spent playing this game on my older brother's Nokia phone. Back then, it didn't get any better when it came to phone games. As simple as it seems, I never grew bored of playing it. I hope you find as much joy playing this game as I did as a kid.

Game: Snake

Built: with Html, CSS and javascript.

Controls: Hit any arrow key to start, then hit left to go left, right to go right, up to go upward and down to go downward. Avoid hitting the borders or your own character's body or the game is over.
